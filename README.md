### About
PS3XploitPlus is basically just a more modern version of the original site. It also has some extra content included.

<br>  

### What's available
Pretty much everything that's on the original website but with added content (firmwares, homebrew, etc). When the site has everything that the original does, and it's usable / partially complete, I MIGHT add games, DLC and mods.

### Credit
Credit goes to the PS3Xploit Team for the original site and any original content hosted on this version. Credit for the redesign goes to Myself.
