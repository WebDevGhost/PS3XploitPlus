### About
PS3XploitPlus is basically just a more modern version of the original site. It also has some extra content included.

<br>  

### What's available
Pretty much everything that's on the original website but with added content (firmwares, homebrew, etc). When the site has everything that the original does, and it's usable / partially complete, I MIGHT add games, DLC and mods.

### Credit
Credit goes to the PS3Xploit Team for the original site and any original content hosted on this version. Credit for the redesign goes to Myself.

### To-Do
- Implement code that saves popup preference via cookies (won't show the popup again unless browser data is cleared).
- Change hyperlinks to buttons.
- Match headers and text to the official sites design.
- Link assets/files to the dropdown options in the navigation bar.
