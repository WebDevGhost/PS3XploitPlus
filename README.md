### About
PS3XploitPlus is basically just a more modern version of the original site. It also has some extra content included. The goal of this version is to build it up bit by bit and add as much as possible.

<br>  

### What's available
- HAN content
- HEN content
- Tools
- Firmwares
- Homebrew
  + More!

Once the site is in a stable and usable state, I MIGHT add more content such as games, DLC, mods, etc.

<br>  

### To-Do
- Change hyperlinks to buttons.
- Match headers. text and colours to the official sites design.
- Link assets/files to the dropdown options in the navigation bar.
- Add responsive styling

<br>
